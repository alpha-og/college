16. Given a family tree with at most two children in each family. We are representing the
    parents by giving either the name of mother or father. Represent the binary tree using
    an array. Program should perform the following:
    a) Display the members of the entire family in the order of generation.
    (members of each generation is displayed on separate line)
    b) Display the children of a person.
    c) Find the parent of a person.
    d) Find the grandparent of a person
    {for array representation the binary tree should be a complete binary tree. If the given tree is not complete make it complete by adding nodes with NULL values.}

17. Write a menu driven program to implement a binary tree using linked list with
    the following operations
    a. Insert a node
    b. Inorder traversal
    c. Preorder traversal
    d. Postorder traversal
    e. Level order traversal (Each level on separate line)
    {Note :- At any time the tree is a complete binary tree. You can create a complete binary tree with the help of a queue. Element of the queue is a pointer to a node.}

18. Write a program to implement a binary search tree with the following
    operations :
    a) Insertion
    b) Deletion
    c) Search
    d) Display the contents {in ascending order}

19. Represent an arithmetic expression using a binary tree, display the expression
    in postfix, prefix and infix form and evaluate it.
    { Input is an infix expression with digits as operands
    [ex1: 8+5*7-4, ex2: (9+5)*(7-5)+8. ]
    Use +, - , \*, / as operands.
    → First convert infix expression to postfix.
    → Then construct the expression tree with the help of a stack
    → Element of the above stack is pointer to a node
    }

20. Write a program to represent any given graph and to do the following operations:
    a. Compute adjacency list and adjacency matrix.
    b. Perform a depth first search
    c. Perform a breadth first search

21. Write a program to read numerical data stored in a text file and implement the
    following sorting algorithms for arranging the numbers in ascending order. Implement
    each algorithm as a separate function. Display the number of comparisons in each case.
    a. Insertion Sort
    b. Selection Sort
    c. Heap Sort
    d. Merge Sort
    e. Quick Sort

22. Write a C program to implement a Hash table
    (a) Using the Chaining method. Let the size of the hash table be 10 so that the index
    varies from 0 to 9.
    (b) Using Linear Probing for collision resolution.

23. Write a C program to simulate a basic memory allocator and garbage collector
    using doubly linked list.
