1. Write a program to find the mode of integer numbers stored in a text file. The mode is the value that occurs the most number of times in the list. Incorporate linear search in your program.

2. A text file contains register number, name and CGPA of students in a class in the following format:

   | (10 characters) | (20 characters) | (5 digits) |
   | --------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
   | Register Number | Name            | CGPA       |

   Details of each student is stored in a separate line. Write a menu driven program for:

   1. Displaying the list of students in the order of register number
   2. Display the name and CGPA of a student with given register number.

   Use bubble sort for preparing list. Find a particular student's details in the list using binary search. Write separate functions for bubble sort and binary search.

3. Write a program to read two polynomials and find their sum.
   (Each polynomial is read in the descending order of exponent of each term)

4. Write a C program to input two sparse matrices in normal form. With the help of a menu do the following operations, each implemented as separate functions:

   1. Convert matrix to tuple form.
   2. Display the matrix in tuple form.
   3. Find the transpose of a matrix represented in tuple form.
   4. Find the sum of the two matrices in tuple form.

5. Input a string of parentheses and braces and determine if it forms a valid string. An input string is valid if:

   1. Every open parenthesis (brac5. has a corresponding close parenthesis (brac5.
   2. Open parentheses (braces) must be closed in the correct order

6. Write a menu-driven program for the following operations:

   1. Convert an infix expression to a postfix expression.
   2. Evaluate the postfix expression.

7. To regulate the crowd in the college students-only-canteen during lunch break, it is decided to implement a token system. You have to program a token management system wherein a student when entering the canteen, proceeds to a token machine. The machine issues him/her a token bearing a number (in the increasing order of the time at which the student arrives) on it. The students are to be served in the order of token numbers. Have a menu to display the following in your program:

   1. The current student being served
   2. Number of students waiting
   3. The last token number issued

8. In a relief camp food packets are supplied to persons based on the following conditions. Only 3 packets are supplied to a person at a time. He will be supplied with tokens according to the number of persons in his family. Only one person from a family is allowed in the queue. There can be a maximum of only N persons in the queue at any time. A person can be allowed to enter the end of the queue if he has to collect more packets. Simulate these conditions using a circular queue with the following operations:

   1. Allow a new person at the end of the queue, if the queue is not full.
   2. Number of persons in the queue.
   3. Display all persons in the queue with the number of tokens they have.
   4. Supplying food to the person in front of the queue.

9. Write a menu driven program to implement a Double-Ended Queue (DEQUEUE). with the following operations. The elements of the queue are strings. Wherever you are deleting an entry from the queue, display whether that string is palindrome or not.
   1. Insert elements to the front of the queue.
   2. Insert elements to the rear of the queue
   3. Delete elements from the Front of the queue.
   4. Delete elements from the Rear of the queue.
   5. Display the contents of the queue.
