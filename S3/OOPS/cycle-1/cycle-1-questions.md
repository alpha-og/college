| 2 | To implement a Java program to check whether a given string is palindrome. |
| 3 | To implement a Java program to find the frequency of a given character in a string. |
| 4 | To implement a Java program to reverse a given string. |
| 5 | To implement a Java program to find the second smallest element in an array. |
| 6 | To implement a Java program to multiply two given matrices. |
| 7 | To implement a Java program to display the transpose of a given matrix. |
| 8 | To implement a Java program to calculate the area of circle, rectangle and triangle. |
| 9 | To write a Java program to create a class called Employee, having data members Name, Age, Phone No. Address and Salary and member function printSalary() to print the salary of the employee. To create 2 classes Officer and Manager that inherit from the Employee class, with data members Department and Specialization. To assign name, age, phone no., address and salary to an officer and manager and to display them. |
| 10 | To write a Java program to declare a class Employee with member functions display() and calcSalary(), and to declare a class Engineer inherited from Employee. To call calcSalary() function of Engineer class and the display() function of the Employee class using a single object instantiation. |
| 11 | To write a Java program to create an abstract class Shape, which contains an empty method numberOfSides(). To derive 3 classes â€“ Rectangle, Triangle and Hexagon- from Shape, each containing the method numberOfSides(). |
| 12 | To write a Java program to demonstrate the concept of interface inheritance. |
| 13 | To write a Java program to demonstrate garbage collection. |
| 14 | To write a file handling program in Java with reader/writer. |
| 15 | To write a Java program that reads a file and displays the file on the screen, with a line number before each line. |
| 16 | To write a Java program that displays the number of characters, words, and lines in a text file. |
| 17 | To write a Java program that reads from a file and write to file by handling all file related exceptions. |
| 18 | To write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the sum of all the integers (Use String Tokenizer class of java.util). |
| 19 | To write a program to show the usage of try, catch, throws and finally. |
| 20 | To write a Java program to create a user-defined exception. |
| 21 | Write a Java program that implements a multi-threaded program which has three threads. First thread generates a random integer every 1 second. If the value is even, second thread computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd the third thread will print the value of cube of the number. |
| 22 | To write a Java program that shows thread synchronization. |
| 23 | To write a Java program to create two threads: One for displaying all odd number between 1 and 100 and second thread for displaying all even numbers between 1 and 100. |
| 24 | To write a Java program that shows Thread priorities. |
| 25 | To write a Java program that works as a simple calculator. Arrange Buttons for digits and the + - * % operations properly. Add a text field to display the result. Handle any possible exceptions like divide by zero. Use Java Swing. |
| 26 | To write a Java program that simulates a traffic light. The program lets the user select one of three lights: red, yellow, or green. When a radio button is selected, the light is turned on, and only one light can be on at a time. No light is on when the program starts. |
| 27 | To write a Java program for the following: A) Create a doubly linked list of elements. B) Delete a given element from the above list. C) Display the contents of the list after deletion. |
| 28 | To write a Java program to perform binary search on an array. |
| 29 | To write a Java program to perform quick sort on an array. |
